WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2500 - This design does not have a PS7 block.
   Instantiate the PS7 block in order to ensure proper fabric tie-offs and
   correct operation of the processing_system7.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <actualiza_IBUF> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     9 out of  13,300    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           33
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             0 out of      33    0%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of 106,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
